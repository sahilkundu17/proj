        <h4>Michael Nyqvist Dies; Veteran Actor Was 56</h4>
        <p>Michael Nyqvist, a Swedish actor who took on the lead role in the initial big screen adaption of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, died on Tuesday
		in Stockholm. He was 56 years old. Nyqvist portrayed journalist Mikael Blomkvist in the original film and its sequels, which were based on the
		blockbuster novel by the same name. He had been suffering from lung cancer for over a year at the time of his death. "Michael's joy and passion
		were infectious to those who knew and loved him," his family said in a statement yesterday, adding: "His charm and charisma were undeniable."
		Gerard Butler, who starred opposite Nyqvist in the movie Hunter Killer, also paid tribute to the actor upon learning of his death. "I just found out
		that he passed today," Butler said on Instagram, expounding as follows: "It feels important to send my condolences because of all the movies I’ve made,
		he was right up there....</p>

                <h4>Spider-Man: Far from home is the latest film to feature trailer scenes you’ll never see</h4>
                <p>In the official trailers for Spider-Man: Far from home, the web-slinging superhero can be seen soaring through the sky . It’s a shot that masterfully hypes the movie in mere seconds: But like so many before it in so many different films, that scene never appears in the film.

        Lost trailer scenes are pretty common. In 2009, io9 rounded up nearly a dozen instances where epic scenes from movie trailers never appeared in the film. When Rogue One hit theaters last year, it joined the roster of high-profile films to leave trailer footage on the cutting room floor.

        The reason behind Far from home missing scenes stands apart, however, as a ScreenCrush interview with director Jon Watts reveals.

        So, the pair wound up with Queens as a backdrop. “Because we couldn’t just create a whole new shot, so let’s just use one of these shots of the subway; put them in there,” Watts says. “I feel a little weird that there’s a shot in the trailer that’s not in the movie at all, but it’s a cool shot.”

        Shooting scenes for a movie that creators have no intention of actually placing in their films can sound a lot like a bait-and-switch. Fans who pay attention to trailers are paying money to see what they’ve been promised. But trailers, and the marketing teams who make them, have a job to make their movies exciting or interesting in just a few minutes. And at a time when trailers have become major draws unto themselves, thanks to hungry online audiences, the need to create content that viewers connect to is even greater.

        The reality is that film trailers are still marketing materials, and marketing materials are there to sell you on an idea. It would’ve been nice to see that scene in Far from home, but you don’t always get what you pay for.

        Correction: A previous version of this piece stated that Spider-Man’s first appearance was in Avengers: Age of Ultron. That was false. His first appearance was in Captain America: Civil War. We’ve updated the piece accordingly..</p>
